# Vue Firebase Connect

Just messing around with Google Firebase and Vue.js.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

## Info

This little app connects to a Firebase example database using vue-resource
* create users
* get/show all users
* delete individual users

* API Keys are in config.js which is not committed but being used as a module.

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
